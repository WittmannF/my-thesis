\noindent \emph{\textbf{Parameters}}

\vspace{4pt}

\begin{description}

    \item [{$D_i$}]     Appliance associated with the state $i$
    \item [{$G_i$}]     Number of time periods in which the state $i$ must be activated
    \item [{$m$}]       Number of time periods in a window
    \item [{$MD_i$}]    Minimum number of time periods in which the state $i$ must be ON
    \item [{$n$}]       Total number of power states in $S$
    \item [{$NP_i$}]    Number of time periods in which $i$ has been activated in the previous window
    \item [{$P_i$}]     Active power state assigned to the index $i$
    \item [{$P(t)$}]    Active power true measurement at time $t$
    \item [{$\rm{prev}_\textit{i}$}]Previous state of $i$ (0 if none)
    \item [{$Q_i$}]     Reactive power state assigned to the index $i$

%    \item [{$TH$}]      Threshold of minimum power to be identified. 
    \item [{$X_i$}]     Final status of the state $i$ within the current window. $X_i=1$ if the state $i$ is ON at the end of the window; otherwise, $X_i=0$.
